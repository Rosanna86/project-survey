# Week 10. # Survey form with React
This week we will be practicing React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. 

## How did I do it?
I started the project by going through the material and videos. I decided pretty fast that I wanted to a survey about something that is close to me: baking. I love to bake. 🍪

What I learned:
* This week we continued with React. And this week I learned about state. useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. And I continued to learn about props, components and how to add everything together.
 👩‍💻

* I did one component for every question, one for every button, one for the summary, one for header and a “parent-component” named form. In form I added all the functions, props and states. This was really helpful for me.

* When I deployed my site and looked on it on my mobile phone (Apple) the fonts on my header image wasn’t aligned at all. Everything looked good in Chrome and in DevTools, so I spent a few hours adapting the CSS so it would look good on the phone.

And I also discovered that links on buttons in iOS15 on mobile turns blue. So I googled that and it seems that it’s a problem. So I had to add color black on my button to make it work.

## When I hit a dead end or a problem
When a problem arose, I either googled, used dev-tools or asked my fellow team mates or class mates for help! 🙌🏻

My own reflection about React
I struggled a lot with JS. But for me React is more logical, why? I don’t really know, but I think it’s the structure? Maybe it’s more close to graphic design? Each component is like a layer in Photoshop or InDesign?
